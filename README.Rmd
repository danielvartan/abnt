## Overview

`tesesusp` is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) format designed for theses and dissertations of the University of São Paulo (USP). It is based on the [`abntex2`](https://www.abntex.net.br/) suite, the [`abntex2ppgsi`](https://www.overleaf.com/project/64f7bdf1641ad4a3a8482800) template, and adheres to the [USP guidelines for creating thesis and dissertation documents](https://teses.usp.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52&Itemid=67&lang=en).

This format extension also includes a [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) template based on the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). While you can use [other Quarto supported languages](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html) with this format, some adaptations may be necessary.

For more detailed information about USP guidelines, please visit <https://teses.usp.br>.

You can view a preview of the rendered template in the `preview` folder.

<!-- To see a practical example of this Quarto format, you can refer to <https://github.com/danielvartan/mastersthesis>. -->

## Instalation

To create a new thesis from scratch, use the following command:

```bash
quarto use template danielvartan/tesesusp
```

This command will install the extension and generate an example `qmd` file and bibliography that you can use as a starting point.

You can also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. To do so, navigate to the Quarto project or document directory and run the following command:

```bash
quarto add danielvartan/tesesusp
```

## Usage

To apply the format, you can use the format name `tesesusp-pdf`. For example:

`quarto render --to tesesusp-pdf`

or in your document `yaml`

``` yaml
format:
  tesesusp-pdf:
    babel-lang: english
```

Since USP guidelines are plentiful, some formatting had to be made using alternative ways. The easy way to start using `tesesusp` is cloning this repository and building on top of its [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).
