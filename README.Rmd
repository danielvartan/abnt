## Overview

`tesesusp` is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) format designed for theses and dissertations of the University of São Paulo (USP). It is based on the [`abntex2`](https://www.abntex.net.br/) suite, the [`abntex2ppgsi`](https://www.overleaf.com/project/64f7bdf1641ad4a3a8482800) template and on [USP guidelines for creating thesis and dissertation documents](https://teses.usp.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52&Itemid=67&lang=en).

This format extension also includes a [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) template designed for use with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). While you can utilize [other Quarto supported languages](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html) with this format, some adaptations may be necessary.

For more detailed information about USP guidelines, please visit <https://teses.usp.br>.

You can preview the template output in the `pdf` folder or by accessing the repository website: <https://danielvartan.github.io/tesesusp>.

To see a practical example of this Quarto format in action, you can refer to <https://github.com/danielvartan/mastersthesis>.

## Installation

To create a new thesis from scratch, use the following command:

```bash
quarto use template danielvartan/tesesusp
```

<!-- Needs testing -->

This command will install the extension and generate an example `qmd` file and bibliography that you can use as a starting point.

You can also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. To do so, navigate to the Quarto project or document directory and run the following command:

```bash
quarto add danielvartan/tesesusp
```

## Usage

To apply this format, use the format name followed by the output type:

`quarto render --to tesesusp-pdf`

You can also set the format in your document `yml`:

``` yaml
format:
  tesesusp-pdf
```

Since USP guidelines are plentiful, some formatting had to be made by inventive/non-conventional ways (to put it mildly). The easy way to start using `tesesusp` is cloning this repository and building on top of its [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/). If you do this, don't forget to install [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) and run `renv::restore()` after.

## Format options

<!-- See <https://github.com/quarto-journals/elsevier>. -->
<!-- See <https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html>. -->

Most customization options available in the Quarto system work with this format. Here are some of them.

### Typography

You can set the document typography using the `mainfont` key. Example:"

``` yaml
format:
  tesesusp-pdf:
    mainfont: Arial
```
[USP guidelines for creating thesis and dissertation documents](https://teses.usp.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52&Itemid=67&lang=en) recommends a `12pt` font size for the body text without specifying a font type.  Common options include `Arial` (default) and `Times New Roman`. Any font available in your system should work.

### Language and hyphenation

At the moment, this Quarto format only supports the English language.

If you're familiar with LaTeX, you can change the order of languages in the `\RequirePackage[spanish, brazil, english]{babel}` command found in  `_extensions/tesesusp/tesesusp.cls`. By doing so, the last one in the list will become the main language of the document.

### Pre-textual pages

At the moment, the pre-textual pages can only be configured using the `yml` configuration and two [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) files located in the `tex` folder.

### Citation management

This template works with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and the [Better BiBTeX](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex) plugin. You must have both installed to render citations.

When rendering the document, the Zotero server must be running; therefore, Zotero must be open. A pre-render script (see `R/quarto-pree-render.R`), created using the [`rbbt`](https://github.com/paleolimbot/rbbt) R package, will scan all `qmd` and `tex` files searching for BibTeX citations (e.g., `@watson1953`). If they match with your Zotero database, the citations will then be written to the `references.json` file.
