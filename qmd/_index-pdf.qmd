"The activity can be represented by a _general schema of problem-solving by the method of imaginative conjectures and criticism_, or, as I have often called it, by _the method of conjecture and refutation_. The schema (in its simplest form) is this

$$
\text{P}_{1} \to \text{TT} \to \text{EE} \to \text{P}_{2} 
$$
```{=latex}
\vspace{1em}
```

Here $\text{P}_{1}$ is the _problem_ from which we start, $\text{TT}$ (the ‘tentative theory’) is the imaginative conjectural solution which we first reach, for example our first _tentative interpretation_. $\text{EE}$ (_‘error- elimination’_) consists of a severe critical examination of our conjecture, our tentative interpretation: it consists, for example, of the critical use of documentary evidence and, if we have at this early stage more than one conjecture at our disposal, it will also consist of a critical discussion and comparative evaluation of the competing conjectures. $\text{P}_{2}$ is the problem situation as it emerges from our first critical attempt to solve our problems.
It leads up to our second attempt (_and so on_). A satisfactory understanding will be reached if the interpretation, the conjectural theory, finds support in the fact that it can throw new light on new problems --- on more problems than we expected; or if it finds support in the fact that it explains many sub-problems, some of which were not seen to start with. Thus we may say that we can gauge the progress we have made by comparing $\text{P}_{1}$ with some of our later problems ($\text{P}_{n}$, say)."
