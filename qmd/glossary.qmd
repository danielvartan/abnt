For an extensive list of chronobiology related terms and definitions, please refer to @aschoff1965 and @marques2012.

Chronotype
: \hspace{20cm} Any kind of temporal phenotype [@ehret1974; @pittendrigh1993]. Usually, it refers to circadian phenotypes in a spectrum that goes from morningness to eveningness [@roenneberg2003b]. It can also be seen as an organism's phase of entrainment [@roenneberg2012a].

Circadian rhythm
: \hspace{20cm} A rhythm with a period close to a day/24h, an approximation to the period of the earth's rotation [@pittendrigh1960]. From the Latin *circā*, around, and *dĭes*, day [@latinitium]. Example: the sleep-wake cycle.

Complex system
: \hspace{20cm} Several definitions exist. The following are particularly useful:

- "Systems that don't yield to compact forms of representation or description" (David Krakauer apud @mitchell2013)
- "A system of many interacting parts where the system is more than just the sum of its parts" (Mark Newman apud @mitchell2013)

Entrainment
: \hspace{20cm} A shift and alignment of biological rhythms induced by a zeitgeber input [@kuhlman2018]. For example: a shift/alignment of an organism's circadian rhythm when exposed to light.
