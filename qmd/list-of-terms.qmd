<!-- @aschoff1965; @marques2012 -->
For an extensive list of chronobiology related terms and definitions, please refer to Aschoff et al. (1965) and Marques & Oda (2012).

<!-- @ehret1974; @pittendrigh1993; @horne1976; @roenneberg2003; @roenneberg2012a -->
Chronotype
: \hspace{20cm} Any kind of temporal phenotype (Ehret, 1974; Pittendrigh, 1993). Usually, it refers to circadian phenotypes in a spectrum that goes from morningness to eveningness (Horne & Ostberg, 1976; Roenneberg et al., 2003). It can also be seen as an organism's phase of entrainment (Roenneberg et al., 2012).

<!-- @pittendrigh1960; @latinitium -->
Circadian rhythm
: \hspace{20cm} A rhythm with a period close to a day/24h, an approximation to the period of the earth's rotation (Pittendrigh, 1960). From the Latin _circā_, around, and _dĭes_, day (Latinitium, n.d.). Example: the sleep-wake cycle.

<!-- @mitchell2013 -->
Complex system
: \hspace{20cm} There are several definitions. Here are some that I found to be of use:

* "Systems that don't yield to compact forms of representation or description" (David Krakauer apud Mitchell, 2013)
* "A system of many interacting parts where the system is more than just the sum of its parts" (Mark Newman apud Mitchell, 2013)
* Systems with many connected agents that interact and exhibit self-organization and emergence behavior, all without the need for a central controller (adapted from Camilo Rodrigues Neto's definition, supervisor of this thesis).
* Dialectics at its finest (my working definition).

<!-- @kuhlman2018 -->
Entrainment
: \hspace{20cm} A shift and alignment of biological rhythms induced by a zeitgeber input (Kuhlman et al., 2018). For example: a shift/alignment of an organism's circadian rhythm when exposed to light.
