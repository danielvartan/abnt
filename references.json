  {"id":"horne1976","abstract":"An English language self-assessment Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire is presented and evaluated against individual differences in the circadian vatiation of oral temperature. 48 subjects falling into Morning, Evening and Intermediate type categories regularly took their temperature. Circadian peak time were identified from the smoothed temperature curves of each subject. Results showed that Morning types and a significantly earlier peak time than Evening types and tended to have a higher daytime temperature and lower post peak temperature. The Intermediate type had temperatures between those of the other groups. Although no significant differences in sleep lengths were found between the three types, Morning types retired and arose significantly earlier than Evening types. Whilst these time significatly correlated with peak time, the questionnaire showed a higher peak time correlation. Although sleep habits are an important déterminant of peak time there are other contibutory factors, and these appear to be partly covered by the questionnaire. Although the questionnaire appears to be valid, further evaluation using a wider subject population is required.","author":[{"family":"Horne","given":"J.

  {"id":"levins1998","abstract":"Systems Theory is best understood in its dual nature as an episode in the generic development of human understanding of the world, and as the specific product of its social history. On the one hand it is a \"moment\" in the investigation of complex systems, the place between the formulation of a problem and the interpretation of its solution where mathematical modeling can make the obscure obvious. On the other hand it is the attempt of a reductionist scientific tradition to come to terms with complexity, non-linearity and change through sophisticated mathematical and computational techniques, a groping toward a more dialectical understanding that is held back both by its philosophical biases and by the institutional and economic contexts of its development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Levins","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"levins1998","container-title":"Science & Society","ISSN":"0036-8237","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"page":"375-399","publisher":"Guilford Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Dialectics and systems theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40403729","volume":"62"},

  {"id":"roenneberg2003","abstract":"Human behavior shows large interindividual variation in temporal organization. Extreme “larks” wake up when extreme “owls” fall asleep. These chronotypes are attributed to differences in the circadian clock, and in animals, the genetic basis of similar phenotypic differences is well established. To better understand the genetic basis of temporal organization in humans, the authors developed a questionnaire to document individual sleep times, self-reported light exposure, and self-assessed chronotype, considering work and free days separately. This report summarizes the results of 500 questionnaires completed in a pilot study. Individual sleep times show large differences between work and free days, except for extreme early types. During the workweek, late chronotypes accumulate considerable sleep debt, for which they compensate on free days by lengthening their sleep by several hours. For all chronotypes, the amount of time spent outdoors in broad daylight significantly affects the timing of sleep: Increased self-reported light exposure advances sleep. The timing of self-selected sleep is multifactorial, including genetic disposition, sleep debt accumulated on workdays, and light exposure. Thus, accurate assessment of genetic chronotypes has to incorporate all of these parameters. The dependence of human chronotype on light, that is, on the amplitude of the light:dark signal, follows the known characteristics of circadian systems in all other experimental organisms. Our results predict that the timing of sleep has changed during industrialization and that a majority of humans are sleep deprived during the workweek. The implications are far ranging concerning learning, memory, vigilance, performance, and quality of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Roenneberg","given":"Till"},{"family":"Wirz-Justice","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Merrow","given":"Martha"}],"citation-key":"roenneberg2003","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","container-title-short":"J Biol Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/0748730402239679","ISSN":"0748-7304, 1552-4531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,2]]},"language":"en","page":"80-90","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Life between clocks: daily temporal patterns of human chronotypes","title-short":"Life between Clocks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730402239679","volume":"18"},
