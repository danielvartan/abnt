# v1.0.0.9000 (development version)

- A GitHub Action workflow was added to ensure that the format builds correctly with the latest Quarto version on different operating systems (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS).
- The documentation was improved and expanded.
- Some minor bug fixes and performance improvements were made.
- The dependencies were updated to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Quarto and related packages.
- `abnt` now offers only an `abnt-pdf` format. The `html` format has been removed. This was done to focus on the primary purpose of the package, which is to provide a LaTeX-based PDF format compliant with ABNT standards.
- The codebase has been restructured for better use and maintainability.
- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes.
